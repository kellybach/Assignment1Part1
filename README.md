Assignment1 Part1 - File system inspector
Team members: Kelly Bach
This project is for anyone looking for a way to parse through their files. By using L [filepath], the user prints all the files listed in that path. With L, the user also has some subcommands. L [filepath] -r lets the user see all files including subdirectories. Replacing -r with -f allows the user to retrieve only files. The subcommands -s and -e allow us to look through the files specifically with the name or file extension, respectively. These commands need more user input to clarify to the program what it is looking for. We can combine the -r and -e or -s commands to look in subdirectories for that specific file. The user can also type Q to quit.
